Give models the ability to query native **MongoDB aggregates** and **build instances** from results.

**Highlights**

* Accepts both Loopback filter's features and pipeline stages, it will merge in a single parsed pipeline to aggregate.  
* Accepts relations' fields within the root where, it will be handled as $lookup stages.
* Refactor the logic from Loopback which is responsible for building the model instances and take advantage of it.
* Supports both callbacks and promises.

This Loopback mixin is intended to be used together with MongoDB connector.
Works for Loopback 2 and 3.

## How to install

Install the package through NPM

```bash
npm i -S @rjnpnigrhi/loopback-mongo-aggregate-mixin
```

Install the package through Yarn

```bash
yarn add --prod @rjnpnigrhi/loopback-mongo-distinct-mixin
```

## Basic configuration

Include the mixin in `server/model-config.json`. Example for Loopback 3:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "sources": [
      "loopback/common/models",
      "loopback/server/models",
      "../common/models",
      "./models"
    ],
    "mixins": [
      "loopback/common/mixins",
      "../node_modules/loopback-mongo-aggregate-mixin/lib",
      "../common/mixins"
    ]
  }
}
```

Enable the mixin in your model definition, ie `person.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "Person",
  "properties": {
    "name": "string"
  },
  "mixins": {
    "Aggregate": true
  }
}
```

## Usage

Invoke `aggregate` method passing either:

* A regular Loopback filter (where, fields, include, order, skip, limit)
* An aggregate pipeline
* A combination of both

### Basic example

> Find a random sample of 3 persons born after 1980:

```js
app.models.Person.aggregate({
  where: {birthDate: {gt: new Date('1980')}},
  aggregate: [{$sample: {size: 3}}],
}, (err, persons) => {
  if (err) return next(err);
  // persons are Person model instances
});
```

### Find where relation properties

Relation properties can be specified in the "where" criteria using dot notation.
$lookup stages will be automatically generated to reach those relations and filter the root documents by such criteria.
it works like a "LEFT JOIN" feature, however it's still necessary to add the "include" filter
if you require the relation to be hydrated.

> Example: Bring persons who are part of a team in which there is some person who is born after 2001

```js
app.models.Person.aggregate({
  where: {'team.persons.birthDate': {$gt: new Date('2001')}},
}, (err, persons) => {
  if (err) return next(err);
  // persons are Person model instances
});
```

Note: It works for hasOne, belongsTo and hasMany. Filtering by embedded properties is not affected and continues to work as usual.

### Do not build instances

Some queries are intended to retrieve data that can not be transformed into model instances.
`aggregate` method will attempt to build instances by default, but this behavior can be disabled
passing an options object `{build: false}` as second argument.

> Example: Bring count of persons by company

```js
app.models.Person.aggregate({
  aggregate: [{
    $group: {
      _id: '$companyId',
      total: {$sum: 1},
    },
  }],
}, {build: false}, (err, groups) => {
  if (err) return done(err);
  // Each group should be a plain object with just 'id' and 'total' attributes  
});
```

### Build instances on demand

The aggregate result often needs some processing before building the model instances.
It's possible to postpone the build phase until the models' data are resolved. 

> Example: Bring the persons count together with a specific page

```js
Person.aggregate([{
  group: {
    _id: null,
    total: {$sum: 1},
    objects: {$push: '$$ROOT'},
  },
}, {
  project: {
    total: 1,
    items: {$slice: ['$objects', pageStart, pageLength]},
  },
}], {buildLater: true}, (err, [data, build]) => {
  if (err) return next(err);
  // data is a plain structure {total, items} where items is an array of documents, not model instances. 
  build(data.items, (err, persons) => {
    if (err) return next(err);
    // now you got persons as Person model instances
  });
});
``` 

* In this case, model documents are not brought as root result,
so we could disable the automatic building by just passing the option `{build: false}`,
but in this case, what we really need is the option `{buildLater: true}`.
* The difference is that `buildLater` will provide us a build function (together with native documents) to invoke by our hand .
Person instances will be finally obtained by calling such function passing `data.items`.
* Build on demand feature it's available as a model static method `Model.buildResult`.

Note: Pipeline array can be directly passed as argument. Also stage names can obviate "$" character.

### GeoNear example

Combine regular "where" with $geoNear stage.
$geoNear will be moved to the pipeline head as MongoDB requires.

```js
app.models.Company.aggregate({
  where: {sector: 'Software'},
  aggregate: [{
    $geoNear: {
      near: {type: 'Point', coordinates: [-0.076132, 51.508530]},
      distanceField: 'distance',
      maxDistance: 5000, // 5Km.
      spherical: true,
    },
  }],
}, (err, companies) => {
  if (err) return done(err);
  // companies are Company model instances
});
```

### Promise support

Methods `aggregae` and `buildResult` support either callback or promise usage.
All the examples above are made with callbacks.
Below it's shown how it's made with promise style.

> Example: Find a random sample of 3 persons born after 1980:

```js
app.models.Person.aggregate({
  where: {birthDate: {gt: new Date('1980')}},
  aggregate: [{$sample: {size: 3}}],
}).then((persons) => {
  // persons are Person model instances
}).catch((err) => {
  // handle an error
});
```


## Advanced configuration

Enable the mixin passing an options object instead of just true.

**Available options:**

| Option                | Type      | Required  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------| --------- | ----------------- |
| mongodbArgs           | object    | optional  | Set defaults for MongoDB aggregate command options (default `{}`). Check the [official documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/aggregate/ "Link to documentation") |
| build                 | boolean   | optional  | Whether to automatically build model instances from aggregate results by default. (default `true`) |
| buildOptions          | object    | optional  | Set defaults for building process options (default `{notify: true}`) |
| buildOptions.notify   | boolean   | optional  | Whether to notify model operation hooks on build by default (default `true`) |

Any of these options can be replaced on the fly with the following syntax:

```js
app.models.Person(filter, options, callback);
```

The `options` argument will be timely merged with the defaults for a single call. 

### Example: Allow MongoDB to use disk

This is a MongoDB aggregate command option that prevent memory issues on large queries.
It can be enabled by default as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "Person",
  "properties": {
    "name": "string"
  },
  "mixins": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "mongodbArgs": {
        "allowDiskUse": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or just enable the option on the fly for a single call:

```js
app.models.Person(filter, {mongodbArgs: {allowDiskUse: true}}, callback);
```

# Debug

Prepend DEBUG environment when running server or tests to display what pipelines are being sent to MongoDB:

```bash
DEBUG=loopback:mixins:aggregate node . # Run server with debug
```

# Testing

Install develop dependences

````bash
npm i -D # If you use NPM
yarn install # If you use Yarn
````

Execute tests

````bash
npm test # Without coverage check
npm run test-with-coverage # With coverage check
````
